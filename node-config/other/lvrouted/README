This is a very simple UDP-based, shortest-path routing daemon.

Each node has a configuration file that lists the directly accessible
ranges and its neighbors. Example:

direct 192.168.3.0/24
neighbor foo 172.17.136.1 wi0

Directly accessible ranges are assumed to be infallible, with the reasoning
that if your ethernet does fail, you have bigger problems than a suboptimal
routing table.

Neighbors have a name, a peer address where it can be reached, and the
interface that address belongs to. I could've written code to figure out
which interface a neighbor is on at runtime, but that would've been a lot of
trouble, unportable and generally not necessary as these configuration files
are going to be script-generated anyway.
