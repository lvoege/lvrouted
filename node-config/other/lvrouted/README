This is a Subversion repository and has a number of directories. You're most
likely looking for trunk/, which you would need to check out with a Subversion
client (http://subversion.tigris.org/) to make use of. The directories are:

trunk/ 			the regular shortest path version in use right now
branches/etx-light	an ETX-like trick to try and cope with asymmetrically
			lossy links.
branches/ipv6		version that can propagate IPv6 addresses.
tags/			this keeps a symbolic record of important versions,
			such as actually deployed versions.

All of the branches are works-in-various-degrees-of-progress. None of the
branches both work and are well tested (because branches that do work and are
well tested get folded back into the trunk).
