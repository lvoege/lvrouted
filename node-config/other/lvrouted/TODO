- integrate MAC.ml and Iface.ml
- test for robustness. see what happens when bogus data does get through.
- something to counter marginal links that flip between being associated
  and not being associated relatively quickly.
- there appears to be the possibility that a route delete command can be
  ignored by the kernel. the fact that a good purge of all routes requires
  multiple "route flush"'s shows it as well. figure something out for this.
  perhaps simply wait a second after the initial Route.commit, and then commit
  the deletes again.
- changes to routes' netmask can be done with a single change-netmask
  message. a lot of delete-then-add's are simply widening or narrowing the
  netmask, so perhaps it is a good idea to indeed use those messages.
