- integrate MAC.ml and Iface.ml
- something to counter marginal links that flip between being associated
  and not being associated relatively quickly. perhaps keep a queue of missed
  receipt deadlines as a sort of cheapo quality metric. the more missed
  deadlines in the last while, the worse the link is.
- looking at -CURRENT's src/sys/net/route.c it appears they're going to be
  pushing 802.11 events through the routing socket. blocking on such a
  socket and waking up whenever something interesting occurs would be much
  better than polling once every such-and-so seconds and checking everything
  ourselves.
