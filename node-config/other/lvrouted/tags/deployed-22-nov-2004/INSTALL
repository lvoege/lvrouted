To install this program:

FreeBSD: 
	pkg_add -r ocaml
	pkg_add -r ocaml-findlib

General:
	You need a BSD make. On BSDs except MacOS X this is the default make.
	MacOS X uses GNU make by default and the one you need is called
	"bsdmake". For Linux there's a port of the NetBSD make. For Debian,
	this is the "pmake" package.
