- 6-CURRENT's seems to have started pushing 802.11 events through the routing
  socket. check if making LowLevel.read_routemsg propagate these up would be
  useful. if they're always accompanied by an address add or remove as the
  other regular routing messages seem to be, this probably won't make much
  difference.

- I think ARP entry additions and expiries also come through the routing
  socket. check, and decide whether to do something with it.

- integrate MAC.ml and Iface.ml. They deal in mostly the same issues, ethernet
  interfaces and their addresses.

= package building = 

- install of documentation files

- man lvrouted(1) perhaps using http://docbook2x.sourceforge.net/
