(* Given a list of nodes and a set of our own addresses, return 
   a list of pruned nodes and a routing table.
   
   1. Initialize a routing table with routes to our own addresses.
   2. Make a temporary node to hook the list in, so the rest of
      the routine can assume to be working on a node structure.
   3. Traverse the tree breadth-first. For every node, check if
      there is a route already. If so, remove this node from
      the list of children in the parent. If not, add a route.
   4. Filter out routes that are included in a route from the
      list of directly attached routes.

   To be able to do this, the callback to the traversal routine
   needs three pieces of information:
     - the node to work on
     - the parent of this node, to be able to remove this node
     - the gateway. The top of every node in the 'nodes'
       parameter is the gateway to the tree under it.

TODO: 4 may be nothing more than cosmetics now that route addition
      finally works right. 4 was added because some of the evidence
      while debugging pointed to such routes acting up. check if it
      is just cosmetic now and note it.
