(* Given a list of nodes and a set of our own addresses, return 
   a list of pruned nodes and a routing table.
   
   1. Initialize a routing table with routes to our own addresses.
   2. Make a temporary node to hook the list in, so the rest of
      the routine can assume to be working on a node structure.
   3. Traverse the tree breadth-first. For every node, check if
      there is a route already. If so, remove this node from
      the list of children in the parent. If not, add a route.
   4. Filter out routes that are included in a route from the
      list of directly attached routes.

TODO: 4 may be nothing more than cosmetics now that route addition
      finally works right. 4 was added because some of the evidence
      while debugging pointed to such routes acting up. check if it
      is just cosmetic now and note it.

   To be able to do this, the callback to the traversal routine
   needs three pieces of information:
     - the node to work on
     - the parent of this node, to be able to remove this node
     - the gateway. The top of every node in the 'nodes'
       parameter is the gateway to the tree under it.
