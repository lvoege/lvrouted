You need to have autoconf, ocaml and ocamlfind installed. Beware that ocaml
versions prior to 3.08-CVS have a small memory leak that will slowly but
surely grow the process. For us, a 64MB soekris machine with twelve neighbors
would last about two weeks before memory got tight. Either arrange to restart
the daemon before then, or use a later version of the ocaml compiler.

Then just:

  $ autoconf && autoheader && ./configure && make

or the specific versions your system provides. so for the FreeBSD machine I'm
writing this on it would be:

  $ autoconf259 && autoheader259 && ./configure && make

and then ignore any errors in docs/ like complaints about a missing dot
binary.

FreeBSD ports needed:
-lang/ocaml
-devel/ocaml-findlib
-devel/autoconf259
-devel/autoheader259
